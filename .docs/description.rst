this is a basic API client for shopware6 which can be used on windows, Linux, MacOs.
It supports all available authorisation types to the Admin and Storefront API.
Paginated requests are supported.

This is only the basic abstraction layer, to enjoy higher level functions, check out "lib_shopware6_api"


On github it can be only tested on linux, because we can not run a docker shopware container service on MacOS or Windows.
